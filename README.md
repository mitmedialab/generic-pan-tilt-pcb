Generic Pan Tilt PCB
====================

This repository contains the KiCAD source files for the printed circuit boards in the Generic Pan Tilt.

![Generic Pan Tilt PCBs](./docs_assets/generic-pan-tilt-pcbs.png)

For each Generic Pan Tilt you will need:
- 1x generic-pan-tilt-pcb
- 2x generic-pan-tilt-motor-pcb
- 1x generic-pan-tilt-home-sensor-pcb

Schematic PDFs, gerbers, bills of materials (including common vendor part numbers), and 3D models may be generated by running KiBot in each directory.

Please note that not all part 3D models are included in this repository due to licensing restrictions.
